I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sheffield, working with Professor [Richard Clayton](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/people/academic/richard-clayton). My current work focuses on developing computational tools for cardiovascular digital twins as part of the [CVD-Net program grant](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/news/digital-twin-heart-modelling-project-will-monitor-patients-virtually). My main research area centres on the identifiability of input parameters. Primarily, I employ a range of identifiability and sensitivity analysis techniques to accurately capture the dynamics of the cardiovascular system. We are developing novel methods that enable us to navigate parameter space, facilitating the personalisation of cardiovascular models to patient-provided medical data. We are also intrested in social population modelling through agent based models to quantify the impact new healthcare digital twins may have on society. I am also interested in the use of the Julia programming language for computational research.

My research combines computational statistics, mathematics, and data science. I have a broad interest in both applying and developing tools for uncertainty quantification and calibration to address social issues, generating new insights through forecasting and prediction. I am also committed to integrating my research into teaching, fostering a positive learning environment through modern methodologies, including high-performance computing, Julia, and physics-informed neural networks.

In the long term, I aim to establish a distinct research identity in the application and development of uncertainty quantification and forecasting methods across diverse fields. My goal is to build an interdisciplinary research group, prioritising interpretability and impact for end-users, such as policymakers, clinicians, and the public. If you have any questions regarding my work, please feel free to reach out to me on any platform.

Biography
------
I obtained a BSc in mathematics from Newcastle university, then a MSc in Mathematical Biology from Heriot-Watt University where my thesis title was as follows Pattern formation in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations. During my studies, I focused on modelling and simulation while also having expertise in optimisation methods, bayesian statistics, sensitivity analysis and group theory. I then completed a PhD in computational statistics focusing on developing new methods for model forecasting and sensitivity/identifiability analysis. The thesis tries to strike the right balance between theoretical development and applied impact in the methods developed. The work within the thesis is applicable to any field despite the focus been concentrated on cardiovascular models.      

Computational Skills
------
I am well skilled in: High performance computing, Matlab, Python, R and most recently Julia. Since the begginning of my PhD I have been using a range techniques from this language. The idea behind the Julia language is that it provides the functionality which is given by Python and R however exhibits speed that seen by C. I have been using a range of machiene learning, Ai and modelling packages. In the near future, I am looking to contribute a modelling package to the Julia community which would provide users with a range of objects which could be easily put together to create a 0D model of the cardiovascular system. I am an active memeber within the Julia community looking to contribute to any projects where Julia could be utilised. In the near future I look to use both machine learning (Lux.jl, SciMLSensitivity.jl) and bayesian statistics (Turing.jl) packages to see how they can apply to the cardiovascular system. 

I am also a memeber of the Julia-Epi community which aim to use Julia to solve problems within epidimiology. I have a pre print out which looks at a new model for the spread of malaria and answers the question as to, even though deaths descrese each year it is often the case that the number of infections remains high each year. Although my current interests are narrow I feel the application of the techniques would be relevant to any situation where modelling is relevant.

Software
------
CirculationModels.jl - is a Julia modelling library, that builds on the ModelingToolkit.jl package, which is part of Julia's SciML framework. It allows efficient and quick implementation of lumped parameter models using an acausal modelling approach. Due to just-in-time compilation and multiple dispatch, models created using this framework achieve a speed-up of one to two orders of magnitude compared to Matlab and Python, and comparable speeds to native C implementations, while using a high-level approach. The library is modular and extensible.

We believe this library will be useful (dare we say, could be a game changer?) for many colleagues working in this field.
